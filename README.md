## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

The Swift Package Manager is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. Itâ€™s integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.

The Package Manager is included in Swift 3.0 and above.

```

## The Basics

### Location Authorization

```swift

```

### Background Location Authorization

```swift
let status = await LocationManager.requestAuthorization(for: .always)	
```

### Notifications Observers

NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(yourSelector),
                                       name: LocationManager.authorizationStatusChanged, object: nil)
