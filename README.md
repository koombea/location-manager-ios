**Location Manager** is a library written in Swift that makes it easy for you to use Apple CoreLocation services.

## Requirements
- iOS 13.0+ 

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

The Swift Package Manager is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. Itâ€™s integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.

The Package Manager is included in Swift 3.0 and above.

```swift
dependencies: [
        .package(name: "LocationManager",
                 url: "https://github.com/koombea/location-manager-ios.git", 
                 from: "1.0.0"),
    ],
```

## The Basics

### Location Authorization

```swift
LocationManager.promptForLocationAuthorization { status in
	//Your code here
}	
```

### Background Location Authorization

It must be used after `promptForLocationAuthorization` [Read more from Apple Docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/cllocationmanager/1620551-requestalwaysauthorization)

```swift
LocationManager.requestBackgroundLocation()	
```

### Notifications Observers

```swift 

NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(yourSelector),
                                       name: LocationManager.authorizationStatusChanged, object: nil)

NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(yourSelector),
                                       name: LocationManager.locationManagerDidFail, object: nil)

NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(yourSelector),
                                       name: LocationManager.locationUpdated, object: nil)

NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(yourSelector),
                                       name: LocationManager.authorizedBackgroundLocation, object: nil)
```
